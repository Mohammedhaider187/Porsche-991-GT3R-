            <h2>Car Information</h2>
            <p>The Porsche 991 GT3 R is a car manufactured for racing, specifically for the GT3 class competition, as it
                is used in racing events such as the Spa 24 Hours. The Porsche 991 GT3 R is mainly known for its
                dominant performance, its impeccable mean look, and its lightweight design, which makes it faster. The
                Porsche 991 GT3 R is a very unique car, making it an eye-catching vehicle. Due to its high performance
                and powerful engine, it is not road-legal.
                <br><br>
                The 991 GT3 R is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six, naturally aspirated engine based on the engine used in
                the 911 GT3 RS road car. It produces 550 horsepower and 460 Nm of torque. The Porsche 991 GT3 R has a
                top speed of around 310 km/h, weighs around 1200 kg, and is rear-wheel drive. It needs to be driven with
                a full safety kit due to its strength and power. It costs around $600,000, and its fuel tank capacity is
                around 64 liters.
                <br><br>
                Although the Porsche 991 GT3 R is an amazing car, it does have some downsides. Firstly, if there is a
                long race, the 991 GT3 R may experience issues with the engine's cooling system, especially if the race
                is in the summer. Additionally, its rear-wheel drive makes it harder to control, particularly on rainy
                days. It is also extremely expensive to find parts for the car, and it is even harder to locate repair
                parts.

            <p>The website shown above is called the <a target="_blank" href="https://acc-liveries.vercel.app/">ACC Livery website</a>, which I used to showcase my liveries. It also
                helped me visualize how my livery design would look in the Assetto Corsa game. The first thing I did was
                choose a car by clicking on the top-left area. I chose the Porsche 991 GT3R, as it has been one of my
                dream cars since childhood. When I first previewed the car, it was painted fully white. I used an app
                called Photoshop to design the graphics, colors, and logos to give it a unique and visually striking
                appearance on the track. I used five sponsors on my car: Monster Energy, Mobil-1, KING Off-Road,
                Yokohama, and Red Bull. I chose green as the primary color for my car because it gives the car a unique
                and aggressive look, and green is also one of my favorite colors.</p>

        <h2>Great Britain - The Silverstone Circuit</h2>

            <h2>Track Information</h2>
            <p>
                The Silverstone Circuit is located near Silverstone in Northamptonshire, England. Before it became a
                race track, it was a Royal Air Force bomber station during World War II. It was then dismantled and
                converted into a racetrack in the late 1940s. The circuit hosted the first F1 World Championship race in
                1950, which was won by an Italian driver named Giuseppe Farina.
                <br><br>
                The Silverstone Circuit is currently 5.9 km long, with 18 turns. It is one of the most famous tracks in
                the world and has hosted the British Grand Prix almost every year since its grand opening in 1950. It is
                known for its challenging turns and difficult layout. The Silverstone Circuit offers guided tours to its
                visitors, as well as driving experiences. Visitors can also enter the museum, which was created in 2019.
                The museum showcases the circuit’s history and allows visitors to experience motorsport technology.
                <br><br>
                Some of the most iconic moments in motorsport history have occurred at this circuit. Lewis Hamilton has
                won the British GP 8 times, holding the record. The primary layout is used for Formula 1 and MotoGP,
                while a smaller layout is used for national and club racing events. The national layout is primarily
                used for beginners, club racing, and testing.

            <p>I used five sponsors in my ACC livery design but my main two sponsors are Red bull and Yokohama as both of them are the two biggest sponsors and also almost every car that races use Yokohama tires as they have the best tires in the tire business. Red bull was one of the first businesses to get sponsored by race cars and is now one of the biggest sponsor on the race cars</p>

            Hello! My name is Mohammed Delshadi from Qatar and I am currently studying computer science at the University of Ulster here in Qatar, born in Doha, Qatar, on July 6, 2005. I have a deep passion for sports and supercars, and that is why when I first turned 18, I got my first sports car, a Toyota Supra. Hopefully, by 25, I will get my dream car, a Porsche 991 GT3R, the car that I made in the ACC livery. I had fun designing the graphics and the colors of the car. My favorite sport, and the only sport I play, is football, and the team that I have been supporting since I was a child is Manchester United.
